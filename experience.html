                        <h3>Part-time research assistant at CPR (December 2020 - September 2022)</h3>
                        <p>
                            As part of the Brunak group in CPR, I was in charge of a software development project while I also took part in 
                            <em>ad hoc</em> tasks for other group members. Within the span of two years I managed to develop a pipeline that 
                            automates Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS). This software dramatically shortens the execution time of 
                            PheWAS analysis by making use of parallelization and other methods. At the end, it also generates a report which 
                            can be opened with a visualization app I developed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my time in this position I got accustomed to working with electronic health records (EHRs), a variety of 
                            genetic/genomic data and the international classification of diseases’ 10th revision (ICD-10). 
                            I also became very fond of the concept of software development and data architecture.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Lecture assistant at KU (September 2021 - Today)</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the skills that I consider very important regardless of an individual’s work position is the ability to 
                            teach/explain topics in varying degrees of complexity. To improve on my ability to communicate and help others I 
                            joined KU as a TA. I have focused on teaching programming and machine learning topics. The courses I have taught to date
                            have been “Introduction to programming for data science”, “Introduction to programming for health sciences” and
                            “Introduction to data science”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my time teaching I came across students that were completely unfamiliar with the course field and did my best to 
                            simplify the topics as much as possible. At the same time I also came across students that were advanced compared to the 
                            rest, and for those I tried to improve engagement by providing them with more advanced concepts and material.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of my time as a TA, I realized the importance of properly communicating the outcome of my work.

                        <h3>Software developer at 3Shape - part time (May 2022 - September 2022)</h3>
                        <p>
                            As my MSc studies were coming to an end I wanted to take advantage of my position and got a part time job at a company as 
                            a software developer. There I became familiar with many programming topics such as software architecture, view models, SCRUM 
                            and I also expanded a lot on my ability to read complex code which is very important in object oriented programming.

                        <h3>PhD at KU - full time (October 2022 - Today)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Based on my previous experience in the Brunak group at CPR I decided to do my PhD there. The PhD topic was not set upon my 
                            acceptance of the position but instead my first task is to review literature and along with my supervisors find a field that is 
                            compatible with my goals and the data which are available to us.
